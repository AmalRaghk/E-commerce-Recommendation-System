## Features

- Personalized product recommendations for users
- Support for collaborative filtering and/or content-based filtering algorithms
- Scalable and modular architecture
- Easy integration with e-commerce platforms
- Data preprocessing and evaluation scripts
- Visualization of recommendation performance

## Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Jupyter Notebook (if present)
- **Libraries:** pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, (add TensorFlow/PyTorch if used)
- **Other:** Jupyter for experimentation, matplotlib/seaborn for visualization (if used)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pip

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AmalRaghk/E-commerce-Recommendation-System.git
    cd E-commerce-Recommendation-System
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. (Optional) Download or prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Place your e-commerce transaction data in the `data/` directory.  
   Modify the data loading script if necessary to fit your data format.

2. **Model Training:**  
   Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Making Recommendations:**  
   Use the prediction script to generate recommendations for users:
   ```bash
   python recommend.py --user_id <USER_ID>
   ```

4. **Evaluation:**  
   Evaluate the recommendation performance by running:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
