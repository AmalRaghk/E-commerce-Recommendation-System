# 🛒 E-commerce Recommendation System

A machine learning-powered product recommendation system tailored for e-commerce platforms! This project helps online retailers suggest relevant products to users based on historical purchasing behavior, enhancing user experience and boosting sales.

## 📌 Overview

This recommendation system uses collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized product suggestions to users. It is built using Python and leverages powerful libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and surprise.

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- ✅ User-Item collaborative filtering using **KNN-based** algorithm
- ✅ Model evaluation with accuracy metrics
- ✅ Interactive product recommendations for test users
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook for step-by-step understanding

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📊
- NumPy ➗
- scikit-learn 🤖
- Surprise (for recommender systems) 🎯
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📈

```

## 📊 Dataset

The system is trained on a dataset containing user ratings for products. It includes:

- **User IDs**
- **Product IDs**
- **Ratings (scale 1–5)**

Dataset: `Amazon_Rating.csv`  
> Note: This is a simulated subset for demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmalRaghk/E-commerce-Recommendation-System.git
   cd E-commerce-Recommendation-System
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open `E-Commerce Recommendation System.ipynb` and follow along!**

## 📈 Example Output

The system recommends top-N products for any given user based on the similarity of their preferences with others.

Sample recommendation format:
```
Recommended Products for User A:
1. Product X
2. Product Y
3. Product Z
```

## 🧪 Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using:

- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- Precision & Recall at K
- Top-N recommendation accuracy
